# numerical exploration:
# - times increase with distance, and increase faster than linearly,
#   e.g. like d^alpha, where alpha > 1 (alpha might depend on sex/course/stroke)
# - men's times are faster than women's (we'd like to estimate how much faster)
# - short course times are faster than long course (more push-offs at end of pool
#   as twice as many lengths in a short course race)
# - could tabulate winning, or average, times for various events,
#   e.g. all events have 200m versions, could tabluate just these
# - freestyle definitely the fastest, breaststroke definitely the slowest,
#   for butterfly/backstroke/medley it depends, e.g. short butterfly races
#   sometimes faster than short backstroke, whereas long butterfly sometimes slower
#   than long backstroke - illustrated in the first 2x2 figure below

#   the mean for all races of that length
# - so moving top row to bottom, observe that devation values decrease,
#   short course times are faster
# - moving left column to right, devations also decrease (men's times faster)
#
# and e.g. women, long course: butterfly faster than backstroke at 100m,
# but these two strokes virtually the same at 200m

# For a female swimmer, swimming freestyle, long course, 50 m race,
# the expected time is exp(3.193) = 24.4 seconds
# and taking the above as the baseline race:
# - if race length doubles, time is multiplied by 2^1.11
# - for a male swimmer, multiply time by exp(-0.105)
# - for butterfly multiply time by exp(0.05), etc for other strokes
# - for short course multiply time by exp(-0.011)
# - if dist doubles and a male swimmer, increase the factor to 2^(1.11+0.00985)
# - if dist doubles and stoke is butterfly, increase by
#   factor of exp(0.05) * 2^(1.11+0.0388)
# - for a male swimmer, butterfly, multiply time by exp(-0.105+0.05-0.008)
# etc
#
# evaluate some of these and discuss, e.g:
# exp(-0.105) = 0.9, the male time for the baseline race is 90% of that for female,
# and since since male interaction coeffs are small in magnitutde compared to 0.9,
# most male times are estimated as about 90% of female times
#
# the effect of distance is like dist^1.11 for the baseline race,
# but if the stroke is changed to butterfly, this changes to d^(1.11+0.0388),
# indicating a faster increase, presumably butterfly is more fatiguing
#
# the multiplying effects of the individual strokes, at the baseline race, are
# freestyle exp(0)=1, butterfly exp(0.05)=1.05, backstroke exp(0.106)=1.11,
# breaststroke exp(0.226)=1.25, medley exp(0.149)=1.16
# i.e. the ordering of strokes expected from original analysis,
# now with estimates of how much slower they are than freestyle (for the baseline race)
#
# maybe not straighforward to understand the consequences of all the coefficient values,
# hence the suggestion of illusrating results with one or two plots (see below)
# and describing/discussing what the plots show
# - plots can show more, and more concisely, than can be described in a few sentences

# -----

# illustrative plots
#
# note that not all races exist at all distances/courses
# e.g. only freestyle/medley exist at 400m, simlarly only some 50m events exist
# so drawing the plots as below involves some extrapolation
# - some extrapolation may be reasonable, e.g. 50m long course backstroke
# - some may not, e.g. 400m butterfly/breaststroke

# RaceA - is ok for prediction: 400m long course, freestyle for women is a standard race
# B - involves some extrapolation, but maybe reasonable extrapolation as 50m short course
#     backstroke races do exist, and we've estimated the difference between short & long
# C - 400m butterfly races don't exist, butterfly times increase the fastest with
#     distance, fatigue is surely a factor, hence predicting a 400m race when 200m is
#     longest that actually exists seems inappropriate extrapolation
# D - we know that medley races are equal number of lengths of the four strokes,
#     this is not possible to have in a long course race of only 100m, so involves
#     extrapolation to experimental conditions that can't possibly exist - not appropriate
#
# we might also wonder what a "prediction" means here - if we are thinking of
# a future Olympics/championship then, as athletic standards are (almost) always
# improving, times in say 2020 are likely to be lower than in 2016 and we have
# no data to use to make allowance for this 
# - maybe we think of it being the average time, in a final, in 2016,
#   for similar elite athletes

# prediction calculation by hand is possible,
# using predict() is definitely better, reassuringly the answers are the same
